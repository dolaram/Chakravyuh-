What is Chakravyuh ?
Chakravyuh is a simple, bare-bones security microprocessor to demonstrate
the ideas of authentication, asymmetric-key cryptography using the celebrated 
RSA algorithm as well as secure on-ship storage of persistent data. 
The motivation for designing this security processor was to attempt the design 
and implementation of an in-house embedded RoT (Root-Of-Trust) which could be 
used in India on commercial security systems like CAS 
(Conditional Access Systems) used in broadcast television applications.

The makers-in-mischief claim no novelty of the ideas presented, this was simply 
a means to do some interesting systems design work using HDL & have fun in 
the whole process !
